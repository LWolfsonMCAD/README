Ohmyword I really hope that SourceTree is the wonderful tool it claims to be.

Otherwise I might have to start punting.

Especially since upgrading my laptop to OSX 10.7 threw a panic kernel...grr.

There's definitely a learning curve, hoping that the icons help, but I'm going to have to find/look through the documentation on the site to see what I see.
