Ohmyword I really hope that SourceTree is the wonderful tool it claims to be.

Otherwise I might have to start punting.

Especially since upgrading my laptop to OSX 10.7 threw a panic kernel...grr.

There's definitely a learning curve, hoping that the icons help, but I'm going to have to find/look through the documentation on the site to see what I see.

Part of me feels like I need to start a to-do list or something, mostly because I have them all over the place and could use one centralized spot. How do I create a comment in a text file by the way? I should probably look that up.
